A encryption and decryption program made by shifting the letters

Implementation ->

Step 1
have a txt extension file with the text you want to encrypt
make sure it is in the same folder as the code file so that the program can access the file. If you want to encrypt a file not present in the parent folder, give the full path.


Step 2
run the file using g++ compiler 

Step 3
give the input file name and the name of the file that is going to be created with the output

Step 4
choose whether you want to encrypted or decrypt a file

Step 5
open the encrypted file

Step 6
to decrypt the encrypted file, rerun the program, this time give the encrypted file as input 

Step 7
enter decrypt and give the key

Step 8
open decrypted file
